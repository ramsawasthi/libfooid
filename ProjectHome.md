libFooID is an open source acoustic fingerprinting library.

libFooID was originally developed in 2006 by Gian-Carlo Pascutto as a research project at the Hogeschool Gent, Belgium.

It was originally distributed at http://www.foosic.org/libfooid/libfooid-1.0.zip but the URL has gone stale and the original source tarball is no longer available.  This project contains code recovered from the Google Code Search cache.
